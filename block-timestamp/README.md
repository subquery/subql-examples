# What is SubQuery?

SubQuery powers the next generation of Polkadot dApps by allowing developers to extract, transform and query blockchain data in real time using GraphQL. In addition to this, SubQuery provides production quality hosting infrastructure to run these projects in.

# SubQuery Example - Timestamp of Blocks

This subquery example indexes the timestamp of each finalized block and it is an example of a CallHandler. By processing the `timestamp.set` extrinsic, and extracting the first arguments of it, we can retrieve the timestamp.

# Getting Started

### 1. Clone the entire subql-example repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/subquery/subql-examples.git

```

### 2. Install dependencies

```shell
cd block-timestamp
# Yarn
yarn

#NPM
npm install
```

### 3. Generate types

```shell
#Yarn
yarn codegen

#NPM
npm run-script codegen
```

### 4. Build the project

```shell
#Yarn
yarn build

#NPM
npm run-script build
```

### 5. Run locally

```shell
#Yarn
yarn start:docker

#NPM
npm run start:docker
```

### 5. Example query to run

```shell
{
  query{
    blockTs{
      nodes{
        blockHeight,
        timestamp
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Understanding this project

As mentioned above, this project has a function called handleTimestampSet which is defined in the mappings file called BlockTs.ts. It uses a [CallHandler](https://doc.subquery.network/create/mapping.html#call-handler) which is defined in the [manifest file](https://doc.subquery.network/create/manifest.html) (project.yaml) as "kind: substrate/CallHandler"

The [schema.graphql](https://doc.subquery.network/create/graphql.html) file defines the variables blockHeight and timestamp which are both mandatory and of type BigInt and Date respectively.

If we examine the code in BlockTs.ts in more detail, you can see that the function handleTimestampSet takes one argument of type SubstrateExtrinsic. It then creates a new instance of BlockTs passing in the extrinsic.blockblock.header.hash argument as a string and assigning this to the variable record.

Next, the blocknumber is converted to a BigInt and assigned to record.blockHeight which is a BlockTs entity meaning that the fields within are accessed with a dot.

For the timestamp, this is extracted from the first argument of the extrinsic using the moments JS library. It then gets converted a Date object, then serialized as a number before being assigned to the timestamp field.
